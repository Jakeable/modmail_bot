## modmail_bot
---

A few scripts designed for AskReddit. Feel free to use them, they should work for you out of the box as long as you set up your secrets.py file correctly.

#### modmail\_archive
---

This is the main reason for writing all of this, we archive all of our threads to a backroom modmail-only subreddit so that we can use the search function mainly.

#### modmail\_actions
---

This script will run occasionally to tabulate moderator actions in modmail based on the database.

#### message\_reader
---

This script doesn't really have a purpose yet, but might be used to read messages for on-demand modmail actions per-mod.

#### mod\_list\_check
---

This is just here to make sure all of our mods have access to all of the backrooms required to make use of them.
